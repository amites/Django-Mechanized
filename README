Django based apps:
    - browser:
	Several shortcuts for working with the Mechanize Library
	See: http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/

    - Proxies
	Shortcuts for finding and using proxies. Use at your own risk.

Source code is documented, please let me know if you run into any issues using either of theses apps. 

They complement each other and should be kept together. If there is enough use I will go through and create a proper package for distribution.
